 Grafana Monitoring Documentation

Introduction to Grafana
Overview
Grafana is an analytics and interactive visualization web application.It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.

Benefits
•	Real-time analytics and visualization.
•	Highly customizable dashboards with multiple integrations.
•	Alerting mechanism for quick responsiveness.

Setting up Grafana
Prerequisites for Installation
•	Docker must be installed on your system.
•	Basic knowledge of Docker command-line usage.

Installation with Docker
This is easiest way Start Grafana using Docker:
“  docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name=grafana grafana/Grafana ”

If Grafana need to add project with multiple containers have to run Grafana via Docker compose.
1.	Create a docker-compose.yaml file.

# first go into the directory where you have created this docker-compose.yaml file
cd /path/to/docker-compose-directory

# now create the docker-compose.yaml file
touch docker-compose.yaml

2.	After that need to add this code to yaml file.

version: "3.8"
services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana-enterprise
    container_name: grafana
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
     - '3000:3000'

3.	To run the file. Need to run this code via terminal.
“docker compose up -d”

•	Default login is `admin` for the username and password.

Initial Configuration
•	Change the default password after the first login.
•	Set up data source configurations and basic user preferences.

•	Save your dashboard through the "Save dashboard" option.
•	Share dashboards by clicking on the "Share" dashboard icon and copying the link or embedding the code.

Using Grafana for Monitoring
Dashboard Usage
•	Use dashboards to get an overview of system metrics and health.
